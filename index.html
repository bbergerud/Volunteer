    <p>In 2017, over $400 billion dollars was donated to charities and organizations
      in the United States, with 70% coming from individual donors. Religious organizations
      are the greatest benefactors with donations totaling $127 billion, followed by
      educational ($59 billion) and human services ($50 billion). While donations have
      reached record highs, the percentage of people donating has been declining
      over the years, dropping from 66% in 2000 to 55% in 2014. This trend has resulted
      in nonprofit organizations turning towards wealthier donors

    <p>
      Besides donating, volunteers play a large part in supporting the services
      of nonprofits. In 2017, around 77 million individuals (about 30% of the US adult
      population) contributed nearly 7 billion hours towards volunteer work, accounting for an
      estimated $167 billion worth of service. The demographic distribution of who volunteered
      in 2017 is given in the table below <a target='_blank' href="https://www.nationalservice.gov/serve/via/">(Volunteering in America)</a>:

    <p>In this project, we'll look at the spatial and demographic aspects of Volunteering in the
      United States at the state level, using data collected from the
      <a href="https://data.nationalservice.gov/Volunteering-and-Civic-Engagement/Volunteering-in-America-State-Data/pvrw-bwct">Volunteering and Civic Life in America</a>
      2017 survey. This survey was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor
      Statistics and published by the Corporation for National and Community Service. About 60,000
      households (100,000 individuals) were surveyed, with respondents asked to indicate the
      type of volunteer activities they participate in as well as the type of volunteer organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple factors to keep in mind is the presence of sampling and response bias,
      as well as rounding to the nearest percent.
    </p>

  <div class='container'>
    <h2>Choropleth</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the simplest way to represent the spatial distribution of the rates of
      volunteer activities and organizations across the US is a choropleth map. For the
      choropleth map below, select whether you want to look at the volunteer activities
      or organizations, then select from the list of options available in the second dropdown
      menu to generate a choropleth map.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you hover over a state, the percentage of volunteers who indicated that they
      participated will be displayed.
    </p>

      <div style='flex-grow:1'>
        <select id='selectGroupUV' class='selectGroup'>
          <option class='acts'>Activity</option>
          <option class='orgs'>Organization</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <div style='flex-basis:75%'>

  </div>

  <div class='container'>
    <h2>Radar Chart</h2>
    <p>One limitation to using a (univariate) choropleth map is that one can only view a single
    variable at any given moment, making it difficult to directly compare volunteer rates
    across several different activities or organizations. One non-spatial visualization
    method that can better aid such a comparison is a radar chart.
    </p>
    <p>For the radar chart below, you can select whether to plot the distribution of Volunteering
      activities or organizations by selecting "Activity" or "Organization" from the dropdown menu respectively.
      The two color palettes can be used for changing the colors used on the graph. The first one corresponds to the states
      that are not selected, while the second color option sets the color for the selected state.
      To highlight a particular state, just select it from the list of states to the left of the chart.

    <h2>Bivariate Choropleth</h2>
    <p>As seen in the introduction, the volunteer rate has a demographic dependence,
    where the oldest and youngest tend to volunteer the least and women more than
    men. One way to visualize the demographic dependence of volunteering is through
    the use of a bivariate choropleth map.
    </p>
    <p>In the bivariate choropleth map below, the states are split by quantile
      for both the demographic variable and the volunteer variable and assigned
      a color based on its quantile rank for each variable. These colors are then
      blended together, as illustrated in the legend below.
    </p>
    <p>For this plot, the demographic data was largely pulled from Wikipedia.</p>

    <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>
    <p>For this last visualization, a simple scatter plot is made based on the data used
      for making the bivariate choropleth map. A log/linear option was added for the couple
      cases where an extreme value exists in the demographic data, such as the very large
      population of California or the population density of Washington D.C. If you hover
      over a data point, the state will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>The volunteer rates have been rounded to the nearest percent in the downloaded file,
      which is why the scatter plot will often have a grid pattern to it.
